# BlueBeary - Stage Separation 2 (SSEP 2) CAD Repository

Instructions for Updates:

- Please be carefull of the file name (see guideline below)
- Be shure to include a clear description for the commits
- ! For macOS users: when commiting, be sure to not have any files named ".DS_Store" (it's a finder thing for previews). Otherwise I'll have to delete it manually and it's a pain in the a** and overflows the list of commits.
